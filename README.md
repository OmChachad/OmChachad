## Hey there, it's Om here! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Om Chachad, a passionate self-taught software developer, tech enthusiast, and content creator from India. I'm the founder and lead developer at [Starlight Apps LLP](https://www.starlightapps.org), where I focus on crafting exceptional iOS, iPadOS, visionOS, and macOS applications with a strong emphasis on user privacy and seamless experiences.

On my [YouTube channel, iTech Everything](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1gctalSScxnaeie9CRK7tw), I share tech reviews, tutorials, and the latest in tech news. When I'm not coding or creating content, I enjoy working on innovative tech projects and [developing powerful Siri Shortcuts](http://itecheverything.com/shortcuts) that simplify everyday tasks.

Check out my work, and let's connect!
